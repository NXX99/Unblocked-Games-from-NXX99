      <hr/>
      <li>Added the Slope game</li>
      <li>Changed the repl title to unlocked gamez from NXX99 to bypass the web filter that schools set up. However, unblocked-games-from-nxx99.nxx99.repl.co is still a valid URL, and it takes you to this URL!</li>

      <li><strong>ALMOST</strong> added a Windows game download service, but Windows games were too big.</li>
      <li>Switched from location.assign to history.back, which gave loading times on my website a speed boost, and allows normal usage of the back and forward arrows on your browser.</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
