    <h2>Hi there! I'm Connor Bowden, an autistic 13 year old nerd who lives in a little-known area called the ArkLaTex. I love Nintendo (Pre-switch), and I have a passion for programming. I made this site back in late 2022 because why not. In my eyes, it's better because instead of having a primary focus on quantity, I primarily focus on quality. I don't want the exact same experience over and over again, so I just stick to games that have actual variety. This means I won't have another version of tetris, because I already have Lumpty Tetris. Also, I like sneaking in little easter <span ondblclick="innerHTML = 'ðŸ¥š'"> egg</span>s. Also, I like low-quality, random, and sometimes weird memes. I use linux instead of Windows because the device that started my linux journey was SUPER slow on Windows 10, and that OS is going to be discontinued in 2025, which is less than 2 years from now. That was MAD funny, Micro$oft, thanks a lot for releasing the modern equivalent to Windows Vista. At least Vista was hyped, Windows 11 was just uncalled for. Anyhow, Another thing I hate is Apple. I HATE APPLE. Here are the reasons why:
    <ol style="text-align:left;">
      <li>Anti-repair tactics. I know most corporations are notorious for this in some degree, but Apple is the worst, as they intentionally screw you over when you repair your Apple stuff.</li>
      <li>They won't stop releasing the exact same thing year after year, like the iPhone 14 is literally just an iPhone 13 with a new front camera style, yet people buy it, being braindead about Apple</li>
      <li>The eco-lies. They say they're being eco-friendly, but these anti-repair tactics, intentionally slowing down old iPhones to "Save battery" which results in people buying a new one, and by-far the worst I can think of right now is putting the BIOS on a low-quality SSD that's soldered DIRECTLY on the motherboard.</li>
      <li>The stans/fanboys. Where do I even begin? They say every android phone takes awful pictures, but I have a 4 year old Galaxy Note 10 plus, and it takes picures REALLY well. They claim android phones are slower. While that sometimes is the case, there's more than one model of android phone. In fact, there's like thousans of android models. The only reason why some things run faster on iOS than android is due to the fact that iOS apps are more optimized to run on 6 gigabytes of RAM, in 2023! These fans say random BS to win against android users, when in reality, they're just completely wrong, like I was in PE this one time in 6th grade, and this moron said that iPhones have "more Wi-Fi", which is impossible. Thanks for turning countless people into brainless imbecles, Apple. </li>
    </ol>
    Anyhow, I like old games, and I have plans on bringing those to here, like the classic sonic games, and even Knuckles Chaotix, which is this game released for the rare Genesis addon called the 32X. I'm not gonna explain that addon here, just look it up on Wikipedia or something. Also, I built my fist PC when I was just 6 years old!</h2>
